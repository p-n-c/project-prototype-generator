# Web Project Generator

## Create new projects from the CLI

To run the generator, you must download it.

From the terminal cd into the `web-project-generator` directory and run:

```bash
npm link
```

This will give you global access to the generator.

Now go to the root directory where the project will be created:

```bash
create-project
```

This will run the generator (provide inputs as required).

Once the project has been built, you will be prompted to run commands to install dependencies and run linters.

To open in VS Code:

```bash
code .
```

[To add the new repo to GitHub using Git](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github)

- Create the new repo
- Follow instructions (copy and paste code suggested in GitHub)
